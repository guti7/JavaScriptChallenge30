  <p>ðŸ–¥ Look at the console</p>

  <script>
    // start with strings, numbers and booleans
    let age = 100;
    let age2 = age;

    console.log(age, age2);

    age = 200;
    console.log(age, age2);

    let name = "Sup";
    let name2 = name;

    console.log(name, name2);
    name = "changed";
    console.log(name, name2);

    // strings, numbers and booleans are passed by value -

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players;

    console.log(players, team);
    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    team[3] = "Luxurious changed the team/ side effect -> players";
    console.log(players, team);
    team[3] = "Poppy"; // Get original players back
    // however what happens when we update that array?
    // Arrays are passed by reference
    // now here is the problem!
    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!
    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    // one way
    const team2 = players.slice()  // takes a copy of the array
    team2[2] = "Changed in team 2";
    console.log(team2);

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players);
    team3.push("Appended to team 3");
    console.log(team3);

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed
    const team4 = [...players]; // using the spread operator
    team4[1] = "We are in the spread";
    console.log(team4);

    // Final way
    const team5 = Array.from(players);
    team5[0] = "From the original";
    console.log(team5);

    console.log("original players intact:");
    console.dir(players);

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Boss',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    const captain = person; // assigns a new reference
    captain.number = 90;

    console.log(captain, person);
    person.number = 80;
    console.log("Back to normal, person:");
    console.dir(person);
    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const person2 = Object.assign({}, person, { number: 99});
    console.log("person 2");
    console.dir(person2);

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.

    const notPerson = {
      name: "bot",
      age: 1000,
      social: {
        twitter: "@bot",
        facebook: "fb.com/bot"
      }
    }

    const botty = Object.assign({}, notPerson); // only does one level, not deep copy

    botty.name = "botty";
    console.log(botty);
    console.log(notPerson);

    const dev2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(notPerson)); // get the JSON string then parse it into an Object.
